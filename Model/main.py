        Create the model.

        Args:
          source_vocab_size: size of the source vocabulary.
          target_vocab_size: size of the target vocabulary.
          buckets: a list of pairs (I, O), where I specifies maximum input length
            that will be processed in that bucket, and O specifies maximum output
            length. Training instances that have inputs longer than I or outputs
            longer than O will be pushed to the next bucket and padded accordingly.
            We assume that the list is sorted, e.g., [(2, 4), (8, 16)].
          size: number of units in each layer of the model.
          num_layers: number of layers in the model.
          max_gradient_norm: gradients will be clipped to maximally this norm.
          batch_size: the size of the batches used during training;
            the model construction is independent of batch_size, so it can be
            changed after initialization if this is convenient, e.g., for decoding.
          learning_rate: learning rate to start with.
          learning_rate_decay_factor: decay learning rate by this much when needed.
          use_lstm: if true, we use LSTM cells instead of GRU cells.
          num_samples: number of samples for sampled softmax.
          forward_only: if set, we do not construct the backward pass in the model.
